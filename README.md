# Hypothesis-Generation

Inspired by Google Knowledge Vault, this project leverages deep learning and random walks to generate features for hypothesis generation. 

## Quick start:
* First, to run these experiments, you will need to install the python dependencies located in requirements.txt. Second, we used the original PRA implementation from Ni et al. This will require Java 7 or higher.
* This project is composed of three different approaches to link prediciton. To make it easire to reproduce the experiments, please navigate to the run directory that contains helper shell scripts.
* The PRA implementation was cloned from here: https://github.com/noon99jaki
